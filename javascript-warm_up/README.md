# JavaScript Basics Project
## Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript Basics Project! This project is designed to help one understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming. By the end of this project, you'll be able to explain why JavaScript is an amazing programming language, how to run JavaScript scripts, and how to create and use variables and constants in your code.

# Learning Objectives
**General**
Why JavaScript Programming is Amazing

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Its ability to run in any web browser makes it accessible and widely used in the development community. JavaScript allows developers to add complex features to websites, such as interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates. Its broad ecosystem, including frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Node.js, further enhances its capabilities and applications.

## How to Run a JavaScript Script

*Running a JavaScript script is straightforward and can be done in several ways:*

**In a Web Browser**: JavaScript code can be embedded in HTML files using <script> tags. This code executes when the web page loads.
**In a JavaScript Console**: Most modern browsers have a developer console where you can write and execute JavaScript code directly.
**Using Node.js**: JavaScript can also be run on the server-side using Node.js. Simply save your script as a .js file and execute it using the Node.js runtime.

## How to Create Variables and Constants

**Variables**: Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that can be changed later in the program. They are declared using the let keyword. For example:

`let age = 25;
age = 26; //` *Variable value can be changed*

**Constants**: Constants are used to store data that should not be changed once set. They are declared using the const keyword. For example:

`const PI = 3.14159;
// PI = 3.14; //` *This would cause an error because PI is a constant*
